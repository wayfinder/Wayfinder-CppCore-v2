//Forward declaration of template class
template<class Target, class EventType>
class CDelayedEvent;

///This template class is used to create user driven events in a
///Symbian program. It's templated on the receiving class and on the
///type of event.
///
///Example:
///<code>
///struct TMyEvent { TInt index; TReal quota; };
///class EventReceiver{
///  CEventGenerator<EventReceiver>* iIntEventGenerator;
///  CEventGenerator<EventReceiver,TMyEvent>* iMyEventGenerator;
/// public:
///  void HandleGeneratedEventL(TInt aEvent);
///  void HandleGeneratedEventL(const TMyEvent& aEvent);
///  EventReceiver()
///  {
///    iIntEventGenerator = CEventGenerator<EventReceiver>::NewL(*this);
///    iMyEventGenerator =CEventGenerator<EventReceiver,TMyEvent>::NewL(*this);
///  }
///  void SendEventsL()
///  {
///    iIntGenerator->SendEventL(1);
///    iIntGenerator->SendEventL(KErrNone);
///    TMyEvent event = { 3, 7.5};
///    iMyEventGenerator->SendEventL(event);
///  }
///};
///</code>
///The example shows a couple of possible uses for CEventGenerator. 
///<ul>
///<li> Each class that defines a function HandleGeneratedEventL(<one arg>) 
///     can be used as an event recipient.
///<li> A class can receive any number of event types by overloading the
///     HandleGeneratedEventL function with different type arguments.
///     By using clever overloading it's possible to handle different 
///     types of events in the same HandleGeneratedEventL function, but 
///     this is of questionable merit. 
///<li> Any type with copy semantics (POD-type or a class with copy 
///     constructor and assignment operator) can be used as event type. 
///     Even pointers can be used, but it's important to keep track of 
///     ownership since the CEventGenerator doesn't delete any external 
///     objects upon destruction. 
///<li> The CEventGenerator object queues event requests. That makes it 
///     possible to add several requests without waiting for request 
///     completion.
///<ul>
///
///Template parameters:
///Target is the event receiving class.
///EventType is the type of event sent to the receiver. Defaults to TInt. 
///
///<h2>Possible extensions<h2>
///By deriving from this class and override the virtual function
///<code>TInt RunError(TInt aError)</code> you can add a handler for
///any Leaves occuring in your HandleGeneratedEventL.
