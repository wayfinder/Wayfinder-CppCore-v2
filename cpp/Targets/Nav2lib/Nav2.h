       * The encodeing directories will then have subdirectories for

       * The CDBP is the base directory for all data files that are
       * the same no matter the architecture. This is useful for
       * making preinstalled media that can be moved between different
       * devices. This directory will contain the map cache, the
       * parameter files, and saved routes.
       *
       * The DBP is the base directory for platform dependent data
       * files. This directory should have a name that is associated
       * with the platform (wayfinder_s80 for Symbian Series 80).
