Hello,

I am pleased to announce that ORBacus 4.1 for C++ and Java and JThreads/C++ 
2.0 have been released and are now generally available.

ORBacus 4.1 includes new functionality and performance improvements over 
ORBacus 4.0.5.

Details on IONA ORBacus 4.1 can be found here:

http://www.iona.com/products/orbacus_home.htm

ORBacus 4.1 can be downloaded after filling out a short download form.

Details on the new features in ORBacus 4.1 can be found here:

http://www.iona.com/products/orbacus_4.1home.htm

ORBacus 4.1 now includes JTC 2.0 in the distribution, so it is no longer 
necessary to download JTC 2.0 separately (JTC 2.0 will, however, remain 
available as a separate download).

JTC (1.x and 2.x) is now free for commercial and non-commercial 
use.  Product help is available via the jtc-users@orbacus.com mailing list.

Cheers,

-Bill
